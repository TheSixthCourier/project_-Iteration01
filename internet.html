      <h3><strong>Module 2: The Internet.</strong></h3>
      <h5>
        Module 2 goes over how the internet, encryption and encoding works.
      </h5>
      <p>
        In CS 1030, Module 2. We go over many aspects as to how the internet
        works and how different aspects of it function in specific. We
        particularly focused on
      </p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <h3>The Internet:</h3>
      <p>
        The internet refers not to websites and apps but to the systems that
        allow all kinds of devices and digital objects to interact.
      </p>
      <h6>Routers:</h6>
      <p>
        Routers refer to any deviced that can be used to transmit data between
        other devices, usually an internet router worsks but computers, TV's
        that can connect to the internet and cellphones work too.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h6>Protocols:</h6>
      <p>
        Protocols are the many systems and programs that handle, control, manage
        and halt many of the Internet's basic abilities. Below is a list of such
        protocols and what they do:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <p>
          IP - Internet Protocol: The Internet address of a device. Used by
          routers for data transmission, Can reveal somebody's real location.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol: The system used to access and jump
          betweeen web pages and websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTTPS - HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure: The more secure version of
          HTTP, it's more resistant against hacking and breachign attemts.
        </p>
        <p>
          DNS - Domain Name System: The system that specifically names out
          pieces of information or websites. Designed to ease up searching for
          anything online.
        </p>
        <p>
          TLS - Transport Layer System: The system that ensures all information,
          sent or recieved, is correct and complete. If any requested data isn't
          complete or correct, The TLS will continue to send out requests for
          that information until complete.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <h6>Internet Attacks:</h6>
      <p>
        Internet attacks are either malicious programs or cyber attacks made to
        damage, destroy or otherwise harm digital systems and services. They can
        range from relatively annoying to outright harmful. Below is a list of
        all kinds of cyber attacks and what they do:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <p>
          Dos/DDos: Denial of Service, attacks done to prevent usage of any
          digital service.
        </p>
        <p>
          DNS spoofing: Redirecting to fake versions of websites to steal
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Phishing: Faked emails or messages preying on trust to steal private
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Malware: Programs that actively harm Computer software or hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
          Virus: Self-replicating programs designed to damage hardware with data
          overflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trojan: Malware disguised as friendly programs designed to trick users
          to gain access to their systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ransomware: Malware that encrypts all information in a PC and locks
          the user out until a ransom of crypto is paid to the hacker.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <h6>Internet Defenses:</h6>
      <p>
        Because of all of the threats that exist online, we have developed all
        manner of different defenses against them. Listed below is a few
        examples of defenses against internet attacks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <p>
          VPN (Virtual Private Network) A program designed to hide a user's IP.
          Preventing hackers from easily getting somebody's IP
        </p>
        <p>
          Firewall: A digital barrier that filters out all sent and recieved
          information and data to make sure no malicious data is transmitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anti-virus: A program that scans through every file within a computer
          or device for any malicious code such as viruses and Malware. If if
          finds anything it then contains it and deletes it.
        </p>
        Two-method verification
        <p>
          Strong Private Password manager: A system made to protect people's
          passwords and automatically enters passwords for users. Risky if
          breached as they usually contain a lot of passwords.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <p></p>

      <h3>Encoding</h3>
      <p>
        Encoding is the usage of programming languages to input information into
        a computer. Encoding is also the process of translating bits into
        legible termns that humans can understand. Encoding uses a few basic
        languages to help programmers communicate with a computer program:
      </p>
      <h6>ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange):</h6>
      <ul>
        <p>
          ASCII is the standard encoding language used to translate basicall
          everything in the english and spanish language. It uses Hexidecimal to
          translate characters, numbers and symbols into Hex and into Bytes. The
          most basic form of encoding, it is the language used to help people
          read code. Each ASCII digit is a four bytes, and can represent every
          letter, symbol and number in the US and UK english alphabet. The
          system works by first performing a best out of 5 from a set of five
          bytes of information to translate each byte into a character in a
          stystem similar to binary. From there it can be converted to
          Hexidecimal to translate characters, numbers and symbols more directly
          into the computer or to represent such symbols on a screen.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h6>Hexidecimal (Hex):</h6>
        <p>
          Hexidecimal is another language similar to ASCII but more in depth.
          It's primarily used in conjunction with RGB to depict specific colors
          in a more technical manner.
        </p>
        <h6>RGB (Red Green Blue):</h6>
        <p>
          A basic language used to represent colors by mixing Red, Green and
          Blue from varying brightness levels. It starts at 0, being the
          darkest, black or nothing, and ending at 255, being brightest and/or
          full color strength. An example of RGB would be shown as (255, 255,
          255) the first number being Red and the last being Blue.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <!--Break for layout.-->
      <h3>Encryption:</h3>
      <p>
        Encryption is the process of hiding information and data behind a cypher
        before to protect it from being red by an unintended third party.
      </p>
      <p>
        In simpler terms, Encryption is done to hide infomation from other
        people. Like hiding messages between two people.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the encryption process, the two clients are given a key to the
        encryption, this key not only acts as their proof of legitimacy but also
        allows their devices to understand the encrypted information they will
        recieve or send.
      </p>
      <p>Encryption is usually handled in two ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <h6>Symmetric:</h6>
        <p>
          Used in more private connections such as private messaging, Company
          systems, etc. In Symmectric Encryption, two clients are given the same
          key to the encryption. This system is much faster as encryption and
          decryption systems don't spend time making new decryption keys and
          encryption systems.
        </p>
        <h6>Asymmetric:</h6>
        <p>
          This system is more commonly used for public connections such as
          online services but can also be private. It's designed to give each
          client a randomly generated decryption key and randomize the
          Encryption each time, ensuring more safety at the cost of being slower
          than its counterpart.
        </p>
        <h5>Decryption:</h5>
        <p>
          Decryption is the process in which a device translates the encrypted
          data into usable information. It's done by obtaining a key that allows
          a device to translate encrypted information into easily understandable
          data.
